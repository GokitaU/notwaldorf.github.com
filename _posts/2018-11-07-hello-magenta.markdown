[Magenta.js](https://magenta.tensorflow.org) is a JavaScript library that helps you generate art and music
on the web. It's also the team that I work on now! One of the things that I do
whenever I join a new team is learn a bunch of things, and then make a bunch of
tutorials that past Monica would've loved to stumble over. This is one of them!

In this tutorial, we'll talk about the music generation bits in
`@magenta/music` (one of the several libraries in Magenta.js) --
how to make your browser sing, and in particular, how to make your browser
sing <em>like you</em>!. The tutorial is interactive, and introductory
and [on Glitch](https://hello-magenta.glitch.me/). Go play with
all the examples, and have fun! ðŸ’•
