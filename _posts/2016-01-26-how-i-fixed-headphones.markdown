Here's the thing: I have this [sweet pair of headphones](http://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/hypebeast-wordpress/image/2008/07/ed-banger-wesc-headphones.jpg) that I got from a
friend a gazillion years ago. I've always liked them because they were
free and they look super quirky but it turns out they were a limited
edition done for Ed Banger Records, which is the label that produces
Justice and Mr. Oizo. It also turns out the wire on the side is getting
a little fuckety, and is probably going to break soon, and my sweet, free, limited
edition headphones are going to be busted. üéß

Here's this other thing you need to know: I am clumsy, and pretty shit at "fixing things".
If I could do it, you could do it, and I'm gonna tell you how.

## Step 0: you should figure out what's wrong
I think about 4 things can go wrong with headphones:

1. one of the cables attached to the headphones speakers is broken
2. the jack is broken
3. there's a hole somewhere in the middle of the cable, most likely because your asshole cat went to town on it
4. the speakers are completely busted

‚Ññ 4 is A Hard Problem‚Ñ¢, and it requires a level of skill I
don't have. ‚Ññ 1 involves re-attaching wires to speakers, and
that's what this post is about. ‚Ññ 2 and 3 are basically a combination of buying
a new cable and re-attaching it to the speakers, which is ‚Ññ 1 again. Which
means you can basically fix 3/4 problems with headphones üíñ.

## Step 1: pop the trunk
After you've figured out which side of your headphones is broken, take the squishy earpad off and figure out how to get inside. Some headphones have little lever
things you need to pop. Mine have 3 little screws. Unscrew them, and place them somewhere where your asshole cat can't eat them.

## Step 2: the wires

Hopefully just one of the wires came loose, so that you don't have to
guess about which wire goes where. If it's just the one, move to the next step.
If, like me, you have to cut the whole cable and resolder all of them, you probably (definitely) should write down what order the wires came in, because you'll forget.
I had this (if you look at the post-soldering photo, this might even make sense):

```
[ ]         [ ]         [ ]   [ ]       soldered and taped
 |           |           |     |            |    |
 |           |           |     |            |    |
fat-orange thin-orange   √ò fat-red     fat-blue thin-blue
```

I also took a picture. It ended up being blurry and useless, so the written note was üëå.

## Step 3: cut some wires

If the cable you're trying to solder is too frayed, you might have to shorten it.
You might also have to [strip](http://www.instructables.com/id/Use-scissors-to-strip-wires!/) the cable if there isn't enough available.

After you're done, you should have a bunch of wires fairly similar to the
ones already attached to the speaker. I stripped mine with a kitchen knife because
I don't own any tools, and it looked like this [read: pretty pro]:

## Step 4: they see me solderin', they hatin'

And that's because I'm hilariously bad at it.

Anyway, here's a super verbose [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLfXXRfRIzY)
on soldering. It basically involves heating the iron, melting some
copper into a liquid ball (if there isn't already enough on there), and using it to attach your wire to the
speaker end it needs to be in. While it's hard to be really good at soldering,
it's surprisingly easy to be averagely bad at it.

The good news is that if
you fuck it up, you can just unsolder the bit you just did with more heat,
and start again. Just practice a little on some spare wires before you go full out on your headphones, and don't burn yourself.

You're going to first unsolder the old wires off the speaker, and re-solder
your new wires on. Here's what mine looked like post soldering. You'll notice
it's messy and that nobody cares, because it's all hidden inside the headphones
anyway. All you care about is your wire making contact with the speaker.

## Step 5: the reckoning
You should plug in your headphones. If everything went great, then sound
should come out of them!

If sound isn't coming out of them, it could be that
your connection is loose and you need to debug your soldering (which means repeating step 4), or that
it wasn't the wires after all üòì

To be honest, the most annoying thing was putting the little earpads back. After serious
struggling, I discovered there's a little wedge on the headphones base, where you can slip a bit of the earpad in,
and then slide it all the way across. I think this is common for most earpad
style headphones.

## You did it! Yay!
If everything went right, you've just fixed a pair of headphones.
High five, friend; I'm proud of you! üëçüíñ
