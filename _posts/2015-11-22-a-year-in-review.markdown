title: "2015: a year in review"
category: posts

I've never really done a year in review. One day, I'd like to [open source](https://github.com/una/personal-goals)
my goals, but since I'm still a chicken, this is a baby step towards that. Plus, this is
one of the first years I'm really proud of, and things that you're proud of tend
to live on the Internet, for posterity.

Here's the TL; DR:

<img alt="2015 contribution graph" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1369170/11983456/85e214b2-a981-11e5-839e-924b058be802.png">

## Burning out
The year started off really poorly. My team had just shipped the new Profiles
UI in Chrome, after a year and a half of hard work, and it was met with a looooot
of Internet anger. On one side we had data to prove that the change we did was right, which made
the powers that be want to stick by it; on the other side I had Twitter,
who was calling me names and wanting me fired. Kind of ironic, since
I was just the person who implemented the feature and had no power
to change it.

I think what burnt me out wasn't waking up to a stream of negative
emails and tweets, it was knowing that there was absolutely nothing I could do about
it other than wait.

So I started working on dumb side projects to feel less miserable. I made a
[link aliaser](http://meowni.ca/meowto/). I bought [dumb](http://canihaveapony.com/)
domains. I wrote [blog](http://meowni.ca/posts/chromium-101/) [posts](http://meowni.ca/posts/chromium-owners)
about the only things that I knew, which were working on Chromium.
I noticed that not working on Chromium made me happy.

So I bit the bullet, left Chromium, and joined Polymer.

## Joining Polymer
Looking back, I picked Polymer for a bunch of dumb reasons that ended up working out
spectacularly well. I wanted to leave Montreal. I wanted to work on JavaScript,
since it was the only thing keeping me going. I didn't want to commute to Mountain View,
which reduced my options by like a billion percent, and I wanted to ship things.
Polymer had all of that. So on April 15, I packed my cat and my books
and moved to San Francisco.

For now, Polymer is my dream job. I get to write code
that I'm genuinely passionate about. I get to try to change the web platform, and talk
about why I think we're doing the right thing. Most importantly, I get to ship
something everyday. It turns out that's a thing that matters to me a lot.

## TL; DR.

I shipped 5 dumb projects:

 - [meowto](http://meowni.ca/meowto/)
 - [emoji-translate](http://meowni.ca/emoji-translate/)
 - [caturday post](https://caturday-post.herokuapp.com/)
 - [emoji-rain](http://meowni.ca/emoji-rain/)
 - [muster](http://meowni.ca/muster/#6&23)
 - [is IE10 dead](http://meowni.ca/is-ie10-dead/)

I gave 5 different talks at 3 conferences and 2 meetups:

 - Contributing to Chromium, [slides](https://speakerdeck.com/notwaldorf/contributing-to-chromium)
 - Push notifications for fun and profit, [slides](https://speakerdeck.com/notwaldorf/push-notifications-for-fun-and-profit-if-by-profit-you-mean-cats), [video](https://vimeo.com/137771040)
 - Styling the Shadow DOM without dragons, [slides](https://speakerdeck.com/notwaldorf/styling-the-shadow-dom-without-dragons), [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbOaJwqLgog)
 - Input I <3 you but you're bringing me down, [slides](https://speakerdeck.com/notwaldorf/input-i-3-you-but-youre-bringing-me-down), [video](https://vimeo.com/144980655)
 - How I didn't fix emoji in Chrome, [slides](https://speakerdeck.com/notwaldorf/or-how-i-didnt-fix-emoji-in-chrome)

I wrote a blog post that a lot of people liked. Most importantly, this happened (#humblebrag):
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I think <a href="https://t.co/eAoYZGWieP">https://t.co/eAoYZGWieP</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/notwaldorf">@notwaldorf</a> may be the best thing I have ever read</p>&mdash; Jeff Atwood (@codinghorror) <a href="https://twitter.com/codinghorror/status/657371215800086529">October 23, 2015</a></blockquote>

I had my first ever interview, on [The Setup](https://usesthis.com/interviews/monica.dinculescu/). I spoke on my
first ever podcast, [Hanselminutes](http://hanselminutes.com/499/understanding-web-components-and-polymer-with-monica-dinculescu).
I discovered [#nailconf](https://www.instagram.com/p/9aW5ZxIrBu), which reassures me I can be a giant nerd and with pretty nails. I kept
3 succulents alive, accidentally killed one, and resurrected a fig leaf tree. I saw my first live
baseball and basketball matches. I bought a second
[ukulele](https://www.instagram.com/p/-VIJ05orDH). I didn't spoil Star Wars for
anybody. I turned 30.

See y'all next year, internet friends!
