This Tuesday I gave my first talk in something like 4 years. I do a fair bit of
speaking on panels / teaching workshops / informal presentations, but I haven't
actually got up in front of a crowd of strangers and tell them about something
I did since I left academia. Nobody threw any pizza crusts or beer bottles at my head, so I guess it didn't go all that terrible.

Anyway, I talked about [cat-dns](http://notwaldorf.github.io/posts/go-cat-dns-go/) at [js-montreal](http://js-montreal.org/). This is what the slides looked like. Imagine reading them in an over-caffeinated, high pitched voice, and it'll be almost like you were there.
