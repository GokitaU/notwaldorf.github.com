My job nowadays involves a lot of music and JavaScript. You know what musicians really
care about? Paychecks (support your local musicians, go to concerts, don't steal music
from indie musicians). But also: keeping time.

Keeping time in JavaScript is kind of a joke, not just because time is a
social construct (this is the Jenn Schiffer social engineering at work), but because it's really easy to write
code that blocks the timekeeper. Remember: JavaScript
inherently only has one thread, which it uses for everything: painting your buttons,
looping through arrays, mining bitcoin, scrolling. Everything.
This means that most of the time, you
write blocking code, but it only blocks for a little bit -- 1ms here and there. And that's ok!
Visually you don't notice that kind of latency, and let's be honest: it takes like 400ms to download the scripts, what's 1ms?

1ms starts getting in the way when it's actually 5ms, or 40 ms, or when you're
trying to have a metronome run correctly. I made a [typing delay experiment](https://input-delay.glitch.me) to see how much delay people could tolerate, and just
for typing alone some people got really antsy around 200ms (shout out
to the section of the population who thought they were heroes because they could
tolerate infinity delay because of how bad ssh latency is. That's not heroic,
that's Stockholm syndrome. Complain to your sys admins).

When I changed that to an [audio delay experiment](https://audio-delay.glitch.me]),
musicians started complaining around 40ms. And that was just audio delay, not
an actual metronome. Imagine that fucking with your audio too! So, keeping time is really important -- but how do we actually do that in JavaScript?

In general, when we want to not block in JavaScript (and do better than
`setInterval`, who is the friend you invite to a party but
shows up like +/- 4h to it), we do one of two things:
start writing `async` functions, or move code to a `Worker` ([Surma](https://twitter.com/dassurma)
has a great [article](https://dassur.ma/things/when-workers/) about workers everyone
should read). In
particular, for audio things, there's a third option: using the Web Audio clock.
Chris Wilson has a [great blog post](https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/audio/scheduling/)
about how to do your own audio scheduling which is a good read. I wanted to
compare these three approaches, and see how bad the latency was. In the case of a metronome,
you want the latency to be as close to 0 as possible, so that 1ms hand wave
from before really doesn't work here.

## Play with the experiment
Me being me, I [made a whole demo](https://metronomes.glitch.me/) to
test and compare these approaches. I built
3 kinds of metronomes:

- a really bad one using `setInterval` on the main thread,
- a less bad one using `setInterval` in a Worker,
- a perfect one using prescheduled Web Audio clock
events).

You can run them on your own in that Glitch, but if you only want
the results, here they are.

## Results

### Setup
There are 3 metronomes, that each tick 20 times, and after each tick, a callback
function is called. For the first 2 metronomes, in this callback you _also_
make the audio tick (except for the Web Audio scheduler metronome, which makes the audio
tick on its own time). The graphs below log the difference between the `audioContext.currentTime`
of successive ticks.

### ðŸ¤” The unrealistic case
This is when you're literally doing 0 work in between the clock ticks. This is
probably never going to happen in a real app unless it's ... just
an actual metronome i guess. In this case, the difference between successive ticks looks
ok for all metronomes -- I mean, why wouldn't it be? You're not scrolling, you're
not doing any work, what's there to block the ticks? There's still a bit of variance between
each ticks, but that's because we know we can't schedule anything (except for the Web Audio
clock) to be _exactly_ 0.5s away.

### ðŸ¤¢ The awful case
Here we are doing 0.5 seconds of fake work on the main thread, after each tick. This
is where things get really dodgy. Because that fake work is blocking, that means that _all_
the metronome callbacks are kind of screwed, and their ticks are delayed by at least 0.5s.
In the second metronome, even though we're calling `setInterval()` in a Worker, it makes no difference because the work from the previous tick is blocking, so it automatically delays the next tick.
In the Web Audio case, we can hear the ticks correctly (the green line), but the callback (which you would use to display things to the screen), is delayed for the same reason
as the other metronomes. Friends don't let friends do work on the main thread.

### ðŸ˜° The better, but still not great case
When we have a big chunk of blocking work, a good approach is to chunk it up in
smaller work. This experiment tries that. We split that 0.5s of work into smaller
5ms chunks, and then do each of them in a `requestAnimationFrame`. This is better!
Now our ticks are only delayed by about 5ms, which might be ok for your use case. The bad main
thread `setInterval` metronome is still doing poorly because there's still
work on the main thread and it keeps time on the main thread, so time is still
wibbly wobbly in this case.

### ðŸ¤© The optimal case
All workers all the time! If you can, do all this expensive work in a Worker!
If we move the work we have to do in the callback completely off the main thread,
then this setup basically looks the same as the unrealistic "there's no work being done ever"
case -- the key distinction is that it's really "there's no work being done _on the main thread_ ever. Hurray!

## What have I learned from this

- time is hard
- I knew `setInterval()` is bad for time keeping, but now I know it's like ... really bad
- if you need audio scheduling, use the Web Audio clock
- if you need accurate scheduling without the Web Audio clock, use `setInterval`
in a Worker
- and if you can, move any expensive work that you have to do from the main thread
to a Worker.

Hope this helps at least one of you!
