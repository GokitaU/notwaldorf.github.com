One of the beefs (and there aren't many) that I have with CSS is that it has a very weak
opinion about style encapsulation. That opinion is basically "well, name your classes well" or else bad
things happen. Know this: I come from C++, land of rules and disappointed compilers; this hand waviness drives me crazy.

This matters because now you have to trust the people that write your css libraries
to have common sense. If my website needs two kinds of fancy buttons, which live in  `shiny-button.css` and `bouncy-button.css`, both libraries
written by silly people who want me to use the `.button` class to get their style,
I'm hosed.

## Enter the Shadow DOM
The [Shadow DOM](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webcomponents/shadowdom-201/) fixes this problem by building a little castle (a dome, get it?) around each custom element, locking in its implementation and styles. This is a proper castle, with a proper moat, so now styles can't get in and out of it. This means that if `<shiny-button>` was a custom element instead of a pile of css, its `.button` class was only relevant
to it, and wouldn't stomp over `<bouncy-button>`'s similarly creatively named `.button` class.

This shouldn't surprise you too much, as native elements have been doing this for years. `<input type=date>` styles the date picker somehow, but you've never worried what class names it might use to do so. You know why? Because you can't get to its castle, that's why.

## The struggle is real
So what happens if you _do_ want to style `<shiny-button>`? What if it's a perfectly
respectable button, but it uses Helvetica as its font and you really need it to be Comic Sans because Helvetica is so 2014?

You can always style the _host_ of the element. Think of the host as literally
the castle walls; you can throw tomatoes at it to paint it:

```css
shiny-button {
  color: white;
  background-color: tomato;
  border-radius: 3px;
  width: 400px;
}
```

What you don't get to do is peek at the implementation of the `<shiny-button>` and decide you don't need one of the nested
divs it uses. Again, these are the same rules that `<input type=date>` plays by: you can change the input's text to be red, but that date picker is what it is (hella ugly).

When the Shadow DOM was first introduced, people anticipated this styling problem and took the "bring an AK-47 to a knife fight" approach by giving every developer [dragons](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webcomponents/shadowdom-201/#toc-style-cat-hat). These dragons are called `/deep/` and `::shadow`, and let you cross the moat and tear the shit out of any castle. You
could style anything you wanted in your custom element, because ain't nobody stopping
dragons. It's like that moat isn't even there:

```css
shiny-button /deep/ fancy-div.fancy-class > .button {
  color: red;
}
```

However, as we know from Game of Thrones, you eventually discover that if you have a dragon, it's going to start eating all your goats and people will regret giving you a dragon.

So we deprecated `/deep/` and `::shadow` and web developers around the world panicked.

## Bridges instead of dragons
The correct answer to "say, how do I cross this moat?" isn't "lol a dragon".
It's a bridge. We've been using bridges to cross waters for like 2000 years. Dragons aren't even real, man.

CSS variables (aka custom properties) do exactly that. They're hooks that the developer of a `<shiny-button>` has left all over the code,
so that you can style the relevant bits. Now you, as the user of a custom element no
longer need to know _how_ that element is implemented. You are given the list of things you can style, and you're set.

From now on, these examples use Polymer, which is what I work on, and what I use to
write custom elements.

Let's say that we have a `<shiny-button>`. It's pretty silly and convoluted, because we have a lot of things to prove. The full code, if you want to play along is [here](http://jsbin.com/qubila/edit?html,output):

<a class="jsbin-embed" href="http://jsbin.com/qubila/embed?html,output">JS Bin on jsbin.com</a><script src="http://static.jsbin.com/js/embed.min.js?3.34.2"></script>

## First, a shiny button
So, here's our button. It has a bunch of nested divs. Everything inside `.container`,
including `.container` itself is inside the Shadow Castle, so it can't be reached:

```html
<dom-module id="shiny-button">
  <template>
    <style>
      :host        { display: inline-block; color: white;}
      .container   { background-color: cornflowerblue; border-radius: 10px; }
      .icon        { font-size: 20px; }
      .text-in-the-shadow-dom { font-weight: 900; }
    </style>
    <div class="container">
      <span class="icon">â™¡</span>
      <span class="user-text"><content></content></span>
      <span class="text-in-the-shadow-dom">!!!</span>
    </div>
  </template>
  <script>
    Polymer({ is: 'shiny-button' });
  </script>
</dom-module>
...
<!-- somewhere in an index.html, you'd use it like so: -->
<shiny-button>I am a button</shiny-button>
```

And it looks like the thing on the left. Pretty meh. We'll do better. We'll style it
to be the thing on the right, without any dragons.

## What can you style right now?
We can only style the _host_ of the element -- this is everything outside the `.container` class.

```css
shiny-button.fancy {
  font-family: "Lato";
  font-weight: 300;
  color: black;
}
```

To see the difference between the host and the container, we can give `shiny-button` above a different
background than the `.container`. The red corners you see are part of the host:

<img width="142" alt="screen shot 2015-08-11 at 3 23 20 pm" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1369170/9212326/ed035506-403c-11e5-848a-9b35bbdc8fce.png">

None of these styles will work, because these divs are well inside the castle:

```css
shiny-button .container {
  color: red;
  background-color: pink;
}
shiny-button .text-in-the-shadow-dom {
  font-weight: 300;
}
```

## And now: some bridges
Let's define a variable for the button's background color, called `--shiny-button-background`. The `--` is not a thing of style: they tell Polymer this is a custom property, that needs to be treated specially. The fact that I am starting all my variables with the name of the custom element _is_ a thing of style: they make it easy to know what you're styling. This is how we would use a custom property, inside the custom element:

```css
.container {
  /* cornflowerblue is a default colour, in case the user doesn't
   * provide one. You could omit it if it's being inherited from above */
  background-color: var(--shiny-button-background, cornflowerblue);
}
```

And this is how you, the user of the element would use it for your custom style:

```css
shiny-button.fancy {
  --shiny-button-background: #E91E63;
}
```

You can add all sorts of hooks for these kinds of "one-off" custom properties. Eventually you might realize that there's too many of them to expose one by one. In that case, you can use a mixin, which is like a bag of properties that should all be applied at once. By default this bag is empty, so nothing gets applied when defining the custom element:

```css
.icon {
    font-size: 20px;
    @apply(--shiny-button-icon);
  }
```

But the user of the element could start adding things to the bag like this:

```css
shiny-button.fancy {
  font-family: "Lato";
  font-weight: 300;
  color: black;
  --shiny-button-background: #E91E63;

  /* this is the mixin! the colon and the semicolon are both important */
  --shiny-button-icon: {
    color: red;
    padding: 10px;
    text-shadow: 0 1px 1px #880E4F;
  };
}
```

That's it, that's all! wasn't that easy?
