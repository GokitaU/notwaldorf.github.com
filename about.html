  <h1>Hiya! I'm Monica.</h1><br/><br/>

  <p>I recently tweeted too much about sportsball and as Twitter penance I promised I would write a blog post about C++ protipz. I didn't have a blog, so here's one about things I find interesting, which may include, but not be limited to, squirrels.</p>

  <p>I'm a developer at Google. I work on <a href="http://www.chromium.org/">Chrome</a> and have probably at least once broken the Internet for you. I'm also a co-organizer of the Montreal <a href="http://mtlallgirlhacknight.ca/">All-Girl Hack Night</a>, and will likely eat all of your Oreos, if you have any.

  <p>Because the internet is a big place, standard disclaimers about these being my views and not my employer's apply.</p>
