  <h1>Hiya! I'm Monica.</h1>

  <p>I'm a Senior Engineer at Google, where I work on <a href="http://magenta.tensorflow.org">Magenta</a>,
    making music and art with Machine Learning. Before this I worked on <a href="https://polymer-project.org">Polymer</a>,
    and was a big advocate for Web Components. Before that, I used to work on
    <a href="http://www.chromium.org/">Chrome</a>. Do you know that little button that has appeared in top right corner
    of your browser? Yeah, I did that (but now it looks different. It's been 6 years after all).

  <p>I have a GitHub AMA <a href="https://github.com/notwaldorf/ama">repo</a> where you can ask me things,
    because I heard that's what the cool kids do nowadays.
    Or you can send me an <a href="mailto:mdinculescu@gmail.com">email</a>. Or both.</p>

  <p>Because the internet is a big place, standard disclaimers about these being my views and not
    my employer's apply.</p>

  <h3 class="rainbow">If you're a conference and you need a bio: </h3>
  <p>Monica works on Magenta, in Google Brain, where she makes generative music and art with Machine Learning. In the
    past she's worked
    on Polymer, Web Components, and Chrome, and has probably at least once broken the Internet for you.
    She is passionate about delightful user experiences, unreasonably excited about emoji, wary of web fonts, and will become your best friend if you bring her
    cheese. On second thought, she may be a mouse.</p>

    one</a>. (Thanks to <a href="https://www.pujaarajan.com">Pujaa Rajan</a> for the headshot!)</p>
