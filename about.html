  <h1>Hiya! I'm Monica.</h1>

  <p>I recently tweeted too much about sportsball and as Twitter penance I promised I would write a blog post about C++ protipz. I didn't have a blog, so here's one about things I find interesting, which may include, but not be limited to, squirrels.</p>

  <p>Most of the time I work on <a href="http://www.chromium.org/">Chromium</a>. Some of the time I co-organize a bunch of Montreal things like  <a href="http://mtlallgirlhacknight.ca/">All-Girl Hacknight</a> and <a href="http://codeforkids.ca/collections/montreal">Code for Kids</a> by night. If you have ideas on how we can make any of those better, we should talk about it. </p>
  
  <p>Because the internet is a big place, standard disclaimers about these being my views and not my employer's apply.</p>
