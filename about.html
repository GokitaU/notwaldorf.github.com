  <h1>Hiya! I'm Monica.</h1><br/><br/>

  <p>One day I tweeted too much about sportsball and as Twitter penance I promised I would write a blog post
  about C++ protipz. I didn't have a blog, so here's one about things I find interesting, which may include,
  but not be limited to, squirrels.</p>
  
  Monica is an emojineer at Google. She works on Magenta where she makes generative music and art with Machine Learning. She used to work on web components and Polymer, and has probably at least once broken the Internet for you
  
  <p>I'm an Emojineer at Google, where I work on <a href="http://magenta.tensorflow.org">Magenta</a>,
  making music and art with Machine Learning. Before this I worked on <a href="https://polymer-project.org">Polymer</a>,
  and was a big advocate for Web Components. Before that, I used to work on
  <a href="http://www.chromium.org/">Chrome</a>. Do you know that little button that has appeared in top right corner
  of your browser? Yeah, I did that. (Did you also know you can set its text to emoji? NOW YOU DO). </p>

  <p>I do a <a href="http://meowni.ca/posts/go-cat-dns-go/">lot</a> of <a href="http://meowni.ca/emojillate">pretty</a>
  <a href="http://meowni.ca/emoji-rain">silly</a>
  side <a href="https://caturday-post.herokuapp.com/">projects</a>, mostly related to
  <a href="http://meowni.ca/emoji-translate/">emoji</a>. I also <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/notwaldorf">talk</a>
  a bunch at conferences about serious topics, but only if they relate to cats, and will probably eat all of your
  Oreos, if you have any.
  </p>

  <p>I have a GitHub AMA <a href="https://github.com/notwaldorf/ama">repo</a> where you can ask me things,
  because I heard that's what the cool kids do nowadays.
  Or you can send me an <a href="mailto:mdinculescu@gmail.com">email</a>. Or both.</p>

  <p>Because the internet is a big place, standard disclaimers about these being my views and not
  my employer's apply.</p>
  
  <h3 class="rainbow">If you're a conference and you need a bio: </h3>
  <p>Monica works on Magenta, in Google Brain, where she makes generative music and art with Machine Learning. In the past she's worked
    on Polymer, web components, and Chrome, and has probably at least once broken the Internet for you. 
    She is unreasonably excited about emoji, wary of web fonts, and will become your best friend if you bring her cheese. 
    On second thought, she may be a mouse.</p>
