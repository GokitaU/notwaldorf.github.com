  <h1>Hiya! I'm Monica.</h1>

  <p>I recently tweeted too much about sportsball and as Twitter penance I promised I would write a blog post about C++ protipz. I didn't have a blog, so here's a blog about things I find interesting, which may include, but not be limited to, squirrels.</p>

  <p>I co-organize a bunch of Montreal things like  <a href="http://mtlallgirlhacknight.ca/">All-Girl Hacknight</a> and <a href="http://codeforkids.ca/collections/montreal">Code for Kids</a>. If you have ideas on how we can make any of those better, we should talk about it. </p>
