  <h1>Hiya! I'm Monica.</h1>

  <p>It was recently discovered that I've been telling people to write blogs and give talks about things they find interesting, because that makes the internet less awful. This discovery promptly got me in trouble, because I neither have a blog, nor give talks. So here's a blog about things I find interesting, which may include, but not be limited to, squirrels.</p>

  <p>I co-organize a bunch of Montreal things like  <a href="http://mtlallgirlhacknight.ca/">All-Girl Hacknight</a> and <a href="http://codeforkids.ca/collections/montreal">Code for Kids</a>. If you have ideas on how we can make any of those better, we should talk about it. </p>
