  <h1>Hiya! I'm Monica.</h1><br/><br/>

  <p>One day I tweeted too much about sportsball and as Twitter penance I promised I would write a blog post 
  about C++ protipz. I didn't have a blog, so here's one about things I find interesting, which may include, 
  but not be limited to, squirrels.</p>

  <p>I've been a developer at Google for two years. I work on <a href="https://www.polymer-project.org/">Polymer</a>, 
  and have probably at least once broken the Internet for you. Before this, I used to work on 
  <a href="http://www.chromium.org/">Chrome</a>. Do you know that little button that has appeared in top right corner 
  of your browser? Yeah, I did that. (Did you also know you can set its text to emoji? NOW YOU DO). </p>
  
  <p>I do a <a href="http://meowni.ca/posts/go-cat-dns-go/">lot</a> of <a href="http://meowni.ca/emoji-rain">silly</a> 
  side <a href="https://caturday-post.herokuapp.com/">projects</a>, mostly related to 
  <a href="http://meowni.ca/emoji-translate/">emoji</a>. I also <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/notwaldorf">talk</a> 
  a bunch at conferences about serious topics, but only if they relate to cats, and will probably eat all of your
  Oreos, if you have any.
  </p>
  
  <p>I have a GitHub AMA <a href="https://github.com/notwaldorf/ama">repo</a> where you can ask me literally
  anything, because I heard that's what the cool kids do nowadays.</p>
  

  <p>Because the internet is a big place, standard disclaimers about these being my views and not 
  my employer's apply.</p>
